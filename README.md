This is an analysis of grade distribution data with the goal of aggregating OSSJA related data.

Grade distribution data is from Fall Quarter 2016 - Fall Quarter 2020 & Fall 2022 - Spring 2025. 
Spring Quarter 2024 and Fall Quarter 2024 are ommited due to technical reasons.

2016 - 2020 data is scraped from https://www.aggieexplorer.com/

Fall 2022 - Spring 2025 data is directly from the registrar.

Results:

Average pre-2020 referals per quarter: 166
Average post-2020 referals per quarter: 362.5

TODO: get the rest of the data from the registrar.

Additional Note: I cannot ensure the accuracy of the Fall 2022 - Spring 2025 data converted to JSON. Other than that the "Y" category is properly carried over. Converting to JSON was a hacky way to get all the data in the same format.
